# Adversarial Examples

This repository aims at exploring the concept of adversarial examples (AE) as well as reproducing some results from key papers.

Currently the repository contains:
1) Replication of the Fast Sign Gradient Method (FGSM) presented in Goodfellow et al., 2014 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf). Experiments based on the information presented in the paper are conducted in the Goodfellow2014_exp.ipynb file.
2) Replication of the iterative methods presented Kurakin et al., 2017 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02533.pdf).
3) train_adv.py containing a script to train a neural network to create adversarial examples.
